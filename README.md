### User Stories

 - As a vegan with an interest in fashion, I want a quick and simple way to track clothing resources I love that do good for animals and the environment.
 - As a user, I want to be able to view my full inventory of retailers and easily link to their websites.
 - As a user, I want my ideas to display cleanly on any device I use.
 - As a user, I want the ability to quickly filter on resources that are either vegan, independent etc. (STRETCH).
 - As a user, I want the ability to upload a photo for each new resource I add (STRETCH).
